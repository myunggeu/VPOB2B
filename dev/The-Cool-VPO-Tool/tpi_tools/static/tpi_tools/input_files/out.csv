SKXSVSPH1H11S0AS801,6270,M7SH412400106,Unit history shows solid Bin 100 for it however there are no major module changes that could have induced that specific Reset failure for lot J750143CR, and then back to recovering.  I see also BIG3 failures for llc at 1400 so this could be induced by other factors external to reet module (also affecting BIG3).,Blank_2018_01_17__11_01_22_6270@SKXSVSPH1H11S0AS801.txt
SKXSVSPH1H11S0AS801,6270,M7SH412401563,Unit history shows mainly a solid Bin 100 behaviour but some ADCALIB incidences on the way and a Bin 1924, however there are no major module changes that could have induced that specific Reset failure and then back to recovering.  This unit could be showing a slight marginality regarding ADCALIB - Reset dependencies but also worth pointing out it belons to same VPO as M7SH412400106 were BIG3 also showing failures for 1400 freq domain.
