visid: M8R42V9100132, Explanation: Core 11 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before, the core is now passing. It looks like we were overkilling in the ref run. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M8R42V9100063, Explanation: Core 8 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before, the core is now passing. It looks like we were overkilling in the ref run. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M83G18S200538, Explanation: Core 25 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before, the core is now passing. It looks like we were overkilling in the ref run. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M8SA531000179, Explanation: Core 15  is failing for CRF ROM read LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before and bypassed the test, we are passing. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M9HC416300797, Explanation: Core 21 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before and bypassed the test, we are passing. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M9HC416301392, Explanation: Core 6 failed for crfallksx_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC_7912 in the ref run, and it is passing in the new run. c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M83G18S200534, Explanation: Core 0 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before, the core is now passing. It looks like we were overkilling in the ref run. In the new run, the unit failed for MIO_DDR module c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS.
visid: M83G18S200379, Explanation: All 28 cores are failing in the new run for c_urfcrqksx_vclmmaxfreq1_VMAXCLMF1. this looks like a tester issue
visid: M83G18S200389, Explanation: Unit failed for reset "BCK:d0619554S2065527_CVk_101xx_PH0000001000xxuRm_xkxxxxxxxx0xxxxx_1FPGETCSx780rrR_d110eUTCVdac:reset_cold_128_cache" in the old run. In the run, it is passing - it looks like a HW induced failure
visid: M83G18S200679, Explanation: Core 5 failed for our rom LTTC screen in the old run. After we reverted the parameters of the screen to what it was before, the core is now passing. It looks like we were overkilling in the ref run. In the new run, the unit failed for SIO module c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC is bypassed in the new SS
visid: M9HC416301032, Explanation: New run is failing all cores in the 3rd pass of CRF ALL LTTC screen, likely HW induced failure
visid: M8R42V9100161, Explanation: Cores 4 and 7 are failing for CRF ROM read LTTC screen in both new and ref runs.  In new run, unit is failing for newly created c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_XCCSP_LTTC XCCSP specific screen and in old run is failing for c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC, which is bypassed in the new SS.
visid: M9HC416301343, Explanation: Core 2 is failing for CRF ROM read LTTC screen in both new and ref runs.  In new run, unit is failing for newly created c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_XCCSP_LTTC XCCSP specific screen and in old run is failing for c_crfrmrscr_vcoreminfreq6_LTTC, which is bypassed in the new SS.
