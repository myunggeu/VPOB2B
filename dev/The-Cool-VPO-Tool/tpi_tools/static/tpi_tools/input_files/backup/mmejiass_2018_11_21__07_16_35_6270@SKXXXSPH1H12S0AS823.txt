visid: M7SH412401046, Explanation: unit failed in SHOPs module on begin flow in old TP, it did not reach failflow where Reset is executed. On new TP it failed Reset when checking for pcie/kti bring up which is consistent with pcie and kti failures seen in past TP runs. Reset module did not change for new TP, failure is not related to this but to a marginality on the unit
visid: M7SH412401211, Explanation: on new TP unit failed inside ADCALIB module on begin flow, it reaches Reset in fail flow where it fails when checking for core bring up because the A/I core vector is set to all 1's (meaning all cores disabled) which makes reset fail, this is due to how the vector is set when it fails inside in ADCALIB module but it is not a reset real failure (reset module did not change between old and new TPs)
visid: M7N7K70500234, Explanation: unit failed in old TP due to tap no able to lock which happens after a failure inside AFCwalk on LLCALIB module on begin flow. on new TP unit did not failed on begin flow, it failed for kti content. Reset module did  not change on new vs old TP, reset is affected by what happens on previous modules
