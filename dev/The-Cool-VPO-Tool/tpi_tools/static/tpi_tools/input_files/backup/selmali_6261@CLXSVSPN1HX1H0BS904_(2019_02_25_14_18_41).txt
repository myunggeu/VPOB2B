visid: M8S78N4500309, Explanation: The unit failed for core 2 at LTTC romread screen for MCI:g0752948S2400541_COe_xx14x_PA00112xxxxxxxxE0_xjxxxxxxxx0xxxxx_1FPGETCSx970rrC_MSU_URM0_romread_k0_sx_2L0xx0xm:cache_vcc_scr_crf_rmr_noa_f3_list. Looking at the history of this unit, it looks like it failed for the same test/ pattern at the same core 2 in S901 TP. If we look at all the units that failed LTTC in old run, it looks like they are all switching to either bin1 or bin13. This looks like a marginal failure due to possibly temperature instability.
