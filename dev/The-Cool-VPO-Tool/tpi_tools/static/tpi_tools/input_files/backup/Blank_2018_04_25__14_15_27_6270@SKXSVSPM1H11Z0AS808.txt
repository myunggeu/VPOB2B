visid: M7J13X7701777, Explanation: The unit failed  due to voltage exceed limit in component CLM0 in scenario 128BP02 of SKU  R3GF. Voltage limit is 0.940. This unit were really close to power limit in TP S724 run. String token: VOLTAGE_:_0.947_EXCEEDS_VRELMAX:_0.940
visid: M7J13X7701269, Explanation: The unit failed  due to voltage exceed limit in component CLM0 in scenario 128BP02 of SKU  R3GF. Voltage limit is 0.940. This unit were really close to power limit in actual TP. String token: VOLTAGE_:_0.946_EXCEEDS_VRELMAX:_0.940. The passing some QDF but any Bucket that have the same QDFs
visid: M7J13X7701271, Explanation: Unit didn't meet any valid recovery configuration. 1111111111000000000011000010_DOESNT_FIT_COREDEFEATURINGVECTOR/12C_THRMLOP_VALUES. Just passing one QDF (not catchall) but ot pass any bucket

This unit were really close to power limit in actual TP. String token: VOLTAGE_:_0.941_EXCEEDS_VRELMAX:_0.940. The passing some QDF but any Bucket that have the same QDFs
visid: M7J13X7700820, Explanation: Unit is failing bin4625 only once throughout the history. Most likely a tester issue // "Unit didn't meet any valid recovery configuration. 1111111111001000110001000000_DOESNT_FIT_COREDEFEATURINGVECTOR/12C_THRMLOP_VALUES. So not pass any QDF.The core 11 was disabled by IDSK.
