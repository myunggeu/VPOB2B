visid: M7N7K70500368, Explanation: There's a passing Bin1 for the same test condition and TP before the unit failed B1330 once. The fail is not valid. Tester/HW issue
visid: M7N7K70500207, Explanation: Unit recovered to Bin1
visid: M7L1Y26800242, Explanation: Unit recovered to Bin1. Fail was due to HW issue
visid: M7SH412400313, Explanation: Fail is invalid. The unit failed Bin1321 once in VPO history due to HW/Tester issue
