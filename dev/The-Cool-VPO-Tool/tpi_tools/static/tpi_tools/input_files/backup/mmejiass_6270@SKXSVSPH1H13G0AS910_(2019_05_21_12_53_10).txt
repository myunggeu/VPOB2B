visid: M7SH412401133, Explanation: unit seems to be marginal, it has failed for different bins since January 2019. not changes to reset module since 2018 that could cause this behavior.
visid: M7N7K70500376, Explanation: unit failed Reset segment121 due to a mismatch between A/I and P/F core mask vector, which is left with this state after failing inside ADC calib module. This failure is due to that incorrect IA core vector and not due to Reset module changes.
