visid: M9FD363600179, Explanation: HW + DCFF limits issue. Old TP B819 due to serial-mode DCFF being executed and failing too tight UKL for G group pins. Old TP executed DCFF due to initial SHOPS fail on ch 8008 (likely HW/contact issue). Both TPs have same DCFF limits, but new TP run did not have HW issue: it passed SHOPS, so DCFF was not executed and therefore no B819
visid: M9FD363600308, Explanation: HW + DCFF limits issue. Old TP B819 due to serial-mode DCFF being executed and failing too tight UKL for G group pins. Old TP executed DCFF due to initial SHOPS fail on ch 10100 (likely HW/contact issue). Both TPs have same DCFF limits, but new TP run did not have HW issue: it passed SHOPS, so DCFF was not executed and therefore no B819
visid: M9FD363600184, Explanation: Failed THRSOAK --> ran DCFF, failed due to too tight UKL for G group pins.
visid: M9FD363600550, Explanation: HW + DCFF Limits issue --  Failed early VCONT test (bad contact?) then executed DCFF. In DCFF, it failed due to too tight UKL for G group pins.
visid: M9FD363600738, Explanation: HW + DCFF limits issue. Failed early VCONT test (bad contact?) then executed DCFF. In DCFF, it failed due to too tight UKL for G group pi
visid: M9DE105401282, Explanation: HW + limits issue. Old TP run passed SHOPS, so DCFF was not executed and therefore no B819. New TP run had a HW issue SHOPS/CRES open fail on ch 8040, so flow then jumped to DCFF, where it failed the too tight UKL for serial-mode G group pins
visid: M9DE105400428, Explanation: IDV fail w/old TP, new TP failed THRSOAK and then executed DCFF before reaching IDV. In DCFF, it failed due to too tight UKL for G group pins
visid: M9DE105400834, Explanation: HW + limits issue. Old TP run passed SHOPS, so DCFF was not executed and therefore no B819. New TP run had a HW issue SHOPS/CRES open fail on ch 8009, so flow then jumped to DCFF, where it failed the too tight UKL for serial-mode G group pins
visid: M9DE105400243, Explanation: Failed THRSOAK w/new TP and then executed DCFF. In DCFF, it failed due to too tight UKL for G group pins
